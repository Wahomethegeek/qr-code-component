## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
 I learned how to style a container, the use of different divs for easier styling.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div>
      <p class="par-1">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
      <p class="par-2">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
```
```css
.par-1 {
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: x-large;
    margin: 20px 30px 20px 30px;
    
}
.par-2 {
    color:  hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    font-weight: 400;
    margin: 20px 30px;
    padding-bottom: 50px;
    padding-left: 10px;
    
 
}
```

### Continued development
I would love now to lear more about flexbox and css grid by doing this I will cover so many projects improving in my skills.
